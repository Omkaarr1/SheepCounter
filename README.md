# SheepCounter

STEPS -->

STEP 1: Take an Arduino Uno R3 Board.

Step 2: Take a Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.

Step 3: Connect the power to 5V Source.

Step 6: Connect the Ground to Ground Source.

Step 7: Connect the TRIG Pin to port 6 of Digital Pin.

Step 8: Connect the ECHO Pin to port 5 of Digital Pin.

Step 9: Same with the Other Ultrasonix Distance Sensor

Step 10: Connect the TRIG Pin to port 11 of Digital Pin.

Step 11: Connect the ECHO Pin to port 10 of Digital Pin.

Step 12: Write the Tinkercad Code as shown below.



EXPLANATION:

Basically the Sensor is placed in the Fence Door Hence whenever a sheep at a time then the counter reads one and when the other enters it again adds one to the previous value and so on now if the sheep leaves the place the value is decremented.
